title: Manmeet
role: "My role in the lab can be summarized as below:  1. Research: I conduct
  high-level research in the field of urban climate and artificial intelligence.
  This could involve studying the effects of climate change on urban
  environments, investigating the impact of urban development on local climates,
  or developing models to predict future climate conditions in urban areas.  2.
  Data Analysis: A significant part of my role involves analyzing data collected
  from various sources. This could include climate data, urban development data,
  or data from experiments conducted in the lab.  3. Publishing and Presenting
  Research: I work towards publishing the research findings in academic
  journals. As a part of my outreach activies, I also present your work at
  conferences or other academic gatherings.  4. Collaboration: I work closely
  with Professor Niyogi and other members of the lab. This could involve
  collaborating on research projects, discussing findings, and developing new
  research questions or hypotheses.  5. Mentorship: I also have opportunities to
  mentor undergraduate or graduate students working in the lab."

bio: Manmeet Singh is Scientist at the Centre for Climate Change Research,
  Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune and an Associate at Jackson
  School of Geosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, USA. He was
  a Fulbright-Kalam fellow at the Jackson School of Geosciences, The University
  of Texas at Austin in 2021. His research interests include climate solutions
  to the problems on land, ocean and atmosphere using mathematical models,
  particularly numerical weather prediction systems. He is especially interested
  in AI/ML techniques, causal approaches, recurrence plots, complex networks and
  non-linear time series analysis for solving grand challenges in Earth System
  Science. He is an experienced climate modeller having contributed to the IITM
  Earth System Model simulations towards the IPCC AR6 report. Together with his
  PhD co-advisor, he developed and coupled the aerosol module of the IITM Earth
  System Model. He is active in teaching and has given invited talks at venues
  such as the NASA/UAH Seminar series, Microsoft India podcast among others. His
  PhD focussed on the impacts of the proposals suggesting volcanic eruptions as
  an analogue of solar geoengineering to halt climate change. Recently, his work
  has shown substantial improvements in high-impact short-range numerical
  weather predictions using deep learning.
