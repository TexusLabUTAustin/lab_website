bio: I am an undergraduate student in Civil Engineering at Howard University. I
  intend to use civil engineering to combat gentrification and its harmful
  effects on minorities. In the TExUS Lab, I am studying the urban heat island
  effect and the best methods to get communities educated and involved in heat
  mitigation.
